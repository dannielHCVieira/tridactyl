# Tridactyl news - Winter 2024

Hello,

Welcome to the tenth Tridactyl newsletter! It looks like I've fallen into a routine of doing them biennially; I'll try to make them at least once a year because we're adding stuff to Tridactyl at such a rate that it becomes a little difficult to summarise it all.

What follows is a brief exploration of the changes in Tridactyl since the last newsletter came out in February 2023.

## Highlighted new features

I'll go through a few of my favourite new features, ones that I myself am using daily. The first is that we added a new `:reader` mode, left unbound by default because while we take every precaution, running it on untrusted websites opens up a larger attack surface than using the built-in Firefox reader (which remains accessible on the `gr` bind and with the `:reader --old` command). You can of course bind to the new mode with `:bind gr reader`, which is what I personally do. This lets you use all of the Tridactyl commands and interface on a minimal "reader" style interface and seems in general to work on slightly more websites than the built-in mode. I use it on websites that go slightly overboard with the cookie warnings, modal newsletter pop-ups and banner adverts ... that is to say, most of them :)

A totally different but equally transformative feature we've added is the ability to sort tabs everywhere in Tridactyl in a "most recently used" fashion. By running `:set tabsort mru`, not only will `b`/`:tab` completions be sorted by recency, but within Tridactyl internally all the commands will use recency indices too, meaning that for example `[n]gt` will take you to the nth-most-recently-used tab rather than the tab with index n. I found it took about a week to get used to but now I can't imagine using Firefox and Tridactyl in any other way. It makes doing housekeeping on tabs easy too, because one can just press shift-tab to get to the end of the `:tab` list in recency to find the ones that haven't been used in a while, and then close them one by one with shift-delete.

For something a little more niche, Tridactyl's support for non-English keyboard layouts has got a little better with the addition of `:set keyboardlayoutforce true`. This forces Tridactyl to see your keyboard as if it was a different layout - by default, US, but configurable via `:set keyboardlayoutbase`. This means that for example, pressing the home row key for the right hand will always be interpreted as j, which is bound by default to scrolling down. If you're frequently switching between keyboard layouts so you can easily type in different languages (for example, colemak and b√©po), your Tridactyl binds will stay in the same physical location.

-   `yq` bind added to display current URL as a QR code, with `q` bind in visual mode. See `:text2qr` for details ([#4728](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4728))

-   `:open` and related commands now have completions for searchurls and previous searches ([#4562](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4562))

Hints
- `:set hintstyles.{bg, fg, outline}` ([#4106](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4106))
- `;c` and `;:` hint modes for context menu and mouse hover added for Linux, both require `:native` to be installed with `xdotool` on the `$PATH`
-   `-x` flag added to `:hint` to exclude CSS selectors from hints ([#4453](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4453))
-   `:hint -C [selectors]` added for custom hint modes while including the default selectors ([#4781](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4781))


-   Experimental support for opening arbitrary pages in the sidebar has been added. See `:help sidebartoggle` and `:help sidebaropen` for more details
-   With the command line open, `<C-o>t` opens a new tab in the background for the selected completion - especially useful with `:back` completions
-   `:jsua` command added to preserve "user action" intent when using browser binds, needed for triggering certain Web Extension APIs such as `browser.sidebarAction.open()`. See `:help jsua` for more information
-   Groundwork for multi-browser support added ([#4768](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4768))
-   Docs are now built and hosted [on our website](https://tridactyl.xyz/build/static/docs/modules/_src_excmds_.html) ([#4732](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4732))


- `tri.bg` and `tri.tabs` added for easy communication between tab and background contexts in `:jsb` and `:js`, see their help pages for more information ([#4891](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4891))

## Neat bug fixes

- JS hints (grey ones) now work again ([#5039](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/5039))
- `:guiset gui none` works again in Firefox 133 ([#5098](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/5098))
- Tridactyl reinserts itself when server-side rendered React websites remove it ([#5053](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/5053))
- `:apropos` will now work even if you have created a custom setting ([#5076](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/5076))

## Plans for next few months

- The command line now buffers character keypresses while it opens so fast typists on slow machines should lose fewer keys ([#4809](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/4809))
- Most `searchurls` have been removed because people (especially me) found them annoying ([#3925](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/3925))
- Added bovine3dom's [mastodon account](https://masto.ai/@bovine3dom) to the new tab page so people can hear him talk about trains

As always, thanks for your generous support,

bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers
